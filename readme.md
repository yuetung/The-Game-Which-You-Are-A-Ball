I broke the AI's automatic shooting

Client not seeing shot projectiles correctly.

Client spawns only one colour?

All colours are the same for the client

The client's energy gui doesn't drop when he shoots

The host's colour doesn't get updated when it picks up a powerup but the the other way works.
